# datenwolf's Code Samples

This is a growing collection of code samples, fully working
demonstration programs I wrote as supplementary material for
articles posted at forums, newsgroups, Q&A sites, blogs,
and so on.

## Structure

Organization is by topic:

* samples/lang/ language specific programming techniques.

* samples/OpenGL/ Everything covering OpenGL, multiple languages

* tools/ Supplementary tools and helpers, for example boilerplate code generators
